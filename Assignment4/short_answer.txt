Warmup
------
Q1. What is the value of `totalMoves` after stepping over the call to `moveTower` in `hanoiAnimation`?
A1. 15 moves

Q2. What is the value of the `totalMoves` variable after stepping over the first recursive sub-call?
(In other words, within `moveTower` and just after stepping over the first recursive sub-call
to `moveTower` inside the `else` statement.)
A2. 7 moves

Q3. After breaking at the base case of `moveTower` and then choosing Step Out, where do you end up?
(What function are you in, and at what line number?)
What is the value of the `totalMoves` variable at this point?
A3. We are in the recursive case of moveTower on line 77. The totalMoves value is 1

Q4. What is the smallest possible input that you used to trigger the bug in the program?
A4. The smallest possible input I provided was {-1, 1}

Q5. Identify the one-character error in the code and explain why that bug causes the function
to return the output you see when running on the minimal input you listed above.
You should be able to specifically account for how the error causes the result to
change from “completely correct” to “terribly wrong.”
A5. The one character error is when recursively calling the function. It should not be 
sumSoFar += v[index] because you are then overriding the sum value each time instead
of continuously updating it.

Predict
-------
Q6. In your own words, describe some of the specific drawbacks to using global variables
and explain why a program-wide constant like keypad does not suffer from the same 
drawbacks.
A6. In general global variables are not recommended because depending on its type, it could be mutable.
Therefore changing the variable at a global scale could seriosuly affect the way in the program you are 
designing runs. A program wide constant can be acceptable because it is a fixed value that you as the 
programmer know will never change. 

Redistrict
----------
Q7. A leader of a political party in your hometown learns you just took CS106B.
They offer you a job working on cutting-edge software that applies algorithms to optimize
gerrymandering during the process of redistricting.

What questions might you ask about this job before making a decision? What might be the drawbacks?
Which communities would be affected by the work you're doing?

Please write your list of 3-5 questions and be sure to include ethical considerations.
A7. 
"Is the current data we have the most up to date?"
"Will we be given enough time to thoroughly test the software to ensure it is working both efficiently and ethically?"
"How are you determing the parameters that this software will take in (like the desired number of districts and the population grid)?"
"Will we be able to effectively communicate within the team to ensure that this software is working as intended?"
