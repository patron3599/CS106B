Hi Iddah! 
As I told you at our first IG, this is my last quarter and I could not have asked
for a better section leader. You were an amazing SL and know it can't be easy having 
to do this on top of your studies. A piece of adivce that I'd like to give you 
(which may be obvious) is to REALLY enjoy your time here a Stanford. There's nothing 
else like this in the world. Also, be sure to always take time for yourself and don't stress
too much about a bad grade here or there; You'd be surprised at how powerful by just having 
Stanford on your resume is. Anyway, you made my last qurter alot more bearable with your 
teaching and I wish you all the best in your future studies!
